# Health Websocket API

The Health Websocket API allows you to get real-time information about the health of your TurboCore instance. This includes information about the number of requests, logs, network traffic, CPU usage, and other metrics.

## Connecting to the API
The Health Websocket API is available at `ws://[DOMAIN]/api/health/ws`. You can connect to the API using any WebSocket client. Before you can start receiving data, you must authenticate with the API. You can do this by sending a message beginning with `auth` and containing a JWT, separated by a space.

Here is an example of connecting to the API in JavaScript:

```js
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://[DOMAIN]/api/health/ws')

const token = getMyToken() // Get JWT from local storage or cookie

socket.onopen(() => {
	socket.send(`auth ${token}`)
})

socket.onmessage((event) => {
	console.log(event.data) // Either "ok" or an error message
})
```

## Commands	

### `auth` - Authenticate with the API (Required)

The `auth` command is used to authenticate with the API. It must be sent before any other commands. The command should be followed by a space and then a JWT. See above for an example. 

### `sysinfo` - Get System Information

The `sysinfo` command is used to get information about the system. This includes information about the CPU, memory, and disk usage. The API will respond with a JSON object containing the following fields:

- `cpus` - An array of CPUs, each containing the following fields:
	- `name` - The name of the CPU reported by the operating system
	- `model` - The model of the CPU reported by the operating system
	- `Usage` - The current CPU usage in percent
- `mem` - An object containing information about the memory usage:
	- `total` - The total amount of memory in bytes
	- `used` - The amount of memory currently in use in bytes
	- `free` - The amount of memory currently free in bytes
	- `swap_total` - The total amount of swap memory in bytes
	- `swap_used` - The amount of swap memory currently in use in bytes
	- `swap_free` - The amount of swap memory currently free in bytes
- `disks` - An array of disks, each containing the following fields:
	- `name` - The name of the disk reported by the operating system
	- `total` - The total amount of disk space in bytes
	- `free` - The amount of disk space currently free in bytes
